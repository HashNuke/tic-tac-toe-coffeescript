# Tic Tac Toe in CoffeeScript

So, go [play](http://akash.im/tic-tac-toe-coffeescript/index.html)

### Running it locally

You'll need a local server because coffeescript compiler is being used to eval coffeescript in the browser.

* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Visit the app at <http://localhost:8000>

### TODO

* [/] Seperate DOM-related stuff from the game classes
* [ ] Jasmine tests
* [ ] IDEA: Scrape TeeSpring homepage and use images of featured tshirts as pawns :)

### Tests

Jasmine is setup. You'll need to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` after you clone the repo to run the tests. Visit <http://localhost:8000/tests/SpecRunner.html>.
